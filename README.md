# fsusieR

R package implementing the Sum of Single Functions ("SuSiF") method.

## Quick Start

Install and load the package:

```r
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("stephenslab/smashr")
remotes::install_github("stephenslab/fsusieR")
```

If this doesn't work, try to install the package instead by
downloading the git repository, and installing from the repository on
your computer (this is assuming that your R working directory is a
directory containing the git repository):

```r
remotes::install_local("fsusieR")
```

```r
devtools::test()
```
